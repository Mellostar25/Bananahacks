# Bananahacks

Inspiration:
Once Grade eight had ended, a lot of us wanted to start volunteering. There weren't many volunteering opportunities flying towards us, it took days to find and select opportunities. For my story, I was lucky to have a teacher who was running in the Federal election, but a lot of my peers struggled to find a place to volunteer. Some places had huge wait-lists. We as a group want to change this and help fellow peers who are entering highschool or who are already in highschool. 

What it does:
The site allows the community to post events, volunteer and job opportunities for the people living in the community. In your post you will provide a time for the event, event info and contact information so the person who is interested will contact you which will lead you to giving the location due to security purposes.
